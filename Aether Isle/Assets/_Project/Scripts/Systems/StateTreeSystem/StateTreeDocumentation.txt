----Class Overview----

-Copyable
	-has a CopyJson() fucntion
	-because we set up the tree with constructors and create new instances, it is useful to be able to copy all the serializable data from a serialized class in the inspector

-Node 
	-the class that the state tree is made up of
	-has a Evaluate() funciton that returns the best State class "below" it
	-has one parent Node and a list of all child Nodes
	-has a Setup() function that is called once the RootNode has been instantiated

-State
	-class where actual behavior code is written
	-has EnterState(), UpdateState(), FixedUpdateState(), and ExitState() functions

-RootState
	-the root of the state tree
	-has UpdateStateTree() which first evaluates all the best states, then updates them accordingly
	-has FixedUpdateStateTree() for the fixed update loop

-HolderState
	-does nothing state
	-useful for organization purposes

-VirtualState
	-has delegate methods for all state methods

-Modifier
	-has a reference to the first state "below" it to modify called child state

-LockDurationModifier
	-when the child state enters, it locks this state for a duration
	-has a depth of how many states to lock
		.lock depth of 1 would lock only the child state so other sibling states cannot enter but allow other states "above" it to change, which would exit the child state
		.lock depth of null would lock all states above it up to the root state

-LockIfModifier
	-has condition of when to lock
	-has lock depth

-NullDurationModifier
	-returns null once a duration has passed after the child state enters

-NullCooldownModifier
	-returns null for a duration once the child state exits

-LockNullModifier
	-combination of LockDuration, NullDuration, and NullCooldown for simplicity

-Selector
	-has an array of child nodes
	-loops through child nodes and returns the first !null state

-Two Selector
	-a Selector with only two children for simplicity

-If 
	-takes a condition and a child Node
	-if the condition is true, it returns the child Nodes Evaluate()
	-else, it returns null

-Comparison
	-has a Calculate() funciton that returns a bool

-VirtualCondition
	-has a delegate bool function

-EventCondition
	-subscribes to an event
	-when that event is called, it will return true the next time the Calculate() function is called
	-could be frame late, depending on script execution order

-Not
-Or
-And
	-all self-explanatory
